        Would you like to learn cool methods to collect and analyze the content shared on social media platforms to understand peopleâ€™s opinions, thoughts, and sentiment about contemporary social, political, business or other issues? Would you like to potentially publish in a IEEE Conference, to boost your graduate school application or your job search? This course might just be right for you! 
 
        This course is structured as a seminar/project-based course where students will read, summarize and present papers, and participate in the classroom discussion based on state-of-the-art research in social media mining. Each student team will conduct a significant research project that analyzes real-life, user-generated data sets capturing major events during the past year including vaccine rollout, cancellation of mask mandates, Asian American hate, etc.  These projects may lead to conference/journal publications, with an additional investment of time and effort. Publications resulting from the past two offerings are listed below.
