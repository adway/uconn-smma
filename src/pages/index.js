        This course is structured as a seminar/project-based course where students will read, summarize and present papers, and participate in the classroom discussion based on state-of-the-art research in social media mining. Each student team will conduct a significant research project that analyzes real-life, user-generated data sets capturing major events during the past year including vaccine rollout, cancellation of mask mandates, Asian American hate, etc.  These projects may lead to conference/journal publications, with an additional investment of time and effort. Publications resulting from the past two offerings are listed below.

          <li>"I think this is really cool course with great opportunity to learn about data mining and scientific papers"<i> Fall 2020 (DL) </i></li>
          <li>"This course is a great for exercising skills in sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning. It was a lot of hard work, but I'm glad that I took this course."<i> Fall 2020 (DL) </i></li>
          <li>"Balancing the freedom of groups to approach the Machine Learning project how they wanted to while also providing enough structure/checkpoints to reach that made it much easier to approach and think about the problems in an efficient way."<i> Fall 2020 (DL) </i></li>
